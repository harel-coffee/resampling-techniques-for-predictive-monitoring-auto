# resampling-techniques-for-predictive-monitoring

### -The codes in the repository uses Artificial Neural Network, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest and Linear Support Vector Machine for training BPIC 2013 dataset.
### -The code implements following resampling techniques: ADASYN, ALLKNN, CNN, ENN, IHT, NCR, OSS, RENN, ROS, RUS, SMOTE, BSMOTE, SMOTEENN and TOMEK
### The overall structure is pretty simple as follows:  
Resampling -> One-versus-All Training -> Testing -> Aggregating the results from the testing results -> Classification based on the aggregated results
